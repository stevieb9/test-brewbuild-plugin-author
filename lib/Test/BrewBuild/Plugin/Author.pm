=head1 NAME

Test::BrewBuild::Plugin::Author - Default test run, but installs author test
distributions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # install various POD and MANIFEST testing distributions, then
    # run the default tests

    brewbuild --plugin Test::BrewBuild::Plugin::Author

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution/module is exactly the same as the default test execution
plugin that is distributed with L<Test::BrewBuild>, which is
L<Test::BrewBuild::Plugin::DefaultExec>. The only difference is this one will
install author-related distributions that will perform the tests typically run
when under the environment variable C<RELEASE_TESTING=1>.

These installed distributions are:

    Pod::Coverage
    Test::Pod::Coverage
    Test::Manifest

We also attempt to set C<$ENV{RELEASE} =1>. If we can't, and a log object is
sent in, we'll log that the environment variable isn't set so author testing
can't be performed.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 brewbuild_exec($log)

Is called by C<Test::BrewBuild::exec()>, executes the test commands provided
by this plugin's C<DATA> section.

Optionally takes a C<Test::BrewBuild::log()> object as a parameter.
